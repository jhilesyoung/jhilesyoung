## Welcome! ðŸ¤“

### About me: 


With a background in communications and customer success, my journey to becoming the ultimate builder and communicator has come full circle with my immersion into coding as a FullStack engineer. I have a knack for public speech and a distinguished ability to present any topic that I'm passionate in(and given time, even topics that I've only just learned).

With a focus in React-Redux, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, PostgresQL, Web-sockets, HTML, and CSS. I'm excited to dive into more technologies and expand my mental library to "npm install" into my software engineering career.
